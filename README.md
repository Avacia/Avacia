# What's up! I'm Yen ðŸ‘‹

I'm a [**full stack developer**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yen-wang-470a33305/) from New Zealand who completed a boot camp at **Mission Ready HQ**.

I've worked with:

- JavaScript
- React
- Node.js / Express.js
- Python
- MySQL
- MongoDB
- Git
- Docker
- RESTful APIs
- Jira
- CLI (Command Line Interface)

For my previous projects, I've explored a wide range of technologies, and now I'm moving on to explore a new field: **Unity and C#**.

My long-term goal is to specialize in a technology stack that includes JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python.
